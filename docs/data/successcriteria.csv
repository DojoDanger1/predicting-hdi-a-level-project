\textbf{No.},\textbf{Success Criterion},\textbf{Justification},\textbf{Success},\textbf{Evidence \& Explanation}
$S_{1}$,Find suitable HDI training data for the Neural Network,The neural network must train on pre-calculated HDI values for certain areas\comma{} along with their respective density and average distance factors.,\checkmark,Section \ref{sec:hdiTrainingData} -- I needed to have the correct HDI for each region\comma{} and by the end of this section\comma{} I had done that.
$S_{2}$,Retrieve OSM data for a given area using Overpass Turbo,This will allow me to calculate useful geographical factors to predict the HDI from instead of more human ones (which are harder to determine).,\checkmark,$T_{1}$ (Table \ref{table:t1testing}) -- This test ensured that I could find a list of all buildings of a specific type\comma{} no matter what the type of building is.
$S_{3}$,Calculate average distance factors from a given area,The average distance from \textit{some object} to \textit{some other object} is also a good measure to consider. For example $A\left(\text{House}\comma{}\text{School}\right)$ is a useful factor as school children shouldn't have to travel long distances for education.,\checkmark,$T_{2}$ \& $T_{3}$ (Tables \ref{table:t2testing} \& \ref{table:t3testing}) -- $T_{2}$ ensured we could calculate the distance between any 2 points\comma{} and $T_{3}$ ensured we could calculate the average distance between 2 types of building.
$S_{4}$,Calculate density factors from a given area,The number of \textit{some object} per unit area is a good way of measuring how many of that object are in a particular area while removing the bias of larger areas.,\checkmark,$T_{4}$ (Table \ref{table:t4testing}) -- This test ensured that we could find the number of a certain type of building per unit area\comma{} no matter how strangely the region is drawn.
$S_{5}$,Successfully Implement the Feedforward Algorithm,This algorithm will allow us to make predictions on the HDI given a set of factors.,\checkmark,Section \ref{sec:testNetwork} \& $T_{5}$ (Table \ref{table:t5testing}) -- Testing the algorithms part of the neural network is difficult\comma{} so they were tested experimentally by training it to recognise handwritten digits in this section.
$S_{6}$,Successfully Implement the Backpropogation Algorithm,This algorithm will allow us to train the neural network base on a set of training examples.,\checkmark,Section \ref{sec:testNetwork} \& $T_{5}$ (Table \ref{table:t5testing}) -- Testing the algorithms part of the neural network is difficult\comma{} so they were tested experimentally by training it to recognise handwritten digits in this section.
$S_{7}$,Successfully train the Neural Network,In order to accurately predict the HDI of a given area\comma{} the neural network must train on existing examples to see what makes a high HDI.,\checkmark,Section \ref{sec:trainNetwork} -- This section was spent training the network\comma{} on predicting HDI. At the end\comma{} we had a set of weights and biases in the network which attempt to predict HDI.
$S_{8}$,User can select an area on the map for which they want to analyse,This will allow the user to choose which area they want to predict the HDI of by drawing on the map.,\checkmark,$FT_{1}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{9}$,Neural Network accurately predicts HDI from those factors,Once the user has selected their area\comma{} the HDI must be predicted based on factors calculated from that area.,Partial \checkmark,$FT_{2}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{10}$,Accurately calculate where a new building would need to be in order to increase the HDI the most,The specific placement of new buildings (as suggestions to increase HDI) is important to consider\comma{} so a suitable place must be chosen in order to decrease the average distance to it as much as possible.,\checkmark,$T_{16}$ (Table \ref{table:t16testing}) -- This test ensured we could find the optimal place to put a new building\comma{} using the new algorithm introduced in the \nth{2} prototype.
$S_{11}$,Changes are suggested to increase the HDI,This will allow the user to make an informed decision on what to do in order to improve their area.,Partial \checkmark,$FT_{3}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{12}$,User can create an account,Eventually\comma{} I would like the user to be able to create an account\comma{} which will allow them to save different areas they have already predicted the HDI of.,\checkmark,$FT_{4}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{13}$,User can log into an account,Once the account has been created\comma{} the user must be able to log into it\comma{} in order to make use of the features.,\checkmark,$FT_{5}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{14}$,User can compare a region to one in the training data,This will allow users to make a judgement on how certain regions have the HDI that they have\comma{} and how they can improve their own.,\checkmark,$FT_{6}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{15}$,User can see how each factor can affect the others,This will allow the user to consider the secondary effects of their descisions\comma{} as the suggested changes may not only increase the HDI\comma{} but also some of the other factors.,\checkmark,$FT_{7}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{16}$,Predicted HDI is ranked among other countries with a similar HDI,This will allow users who are not that familiar with HDI to get an idea of the HDI scale by comparing it to the gist of what they know.,\checkmark,$FT_{8}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{17}$,User can save regions,This will allow users to save time and not re-download the buildings \& re-calculate the factors. Users with an account should also be able to store regions there.,\checkmark,$FT_{9}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{18}$,User can manualy enter factors,If downloading \& calculating the factors takes too long\comma{} the user may manually enter them instead.,\checkmark,$FT_{10}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingFunction}) -- This was tested as part of Final Testing for Function.
$S_{19}$,App has a clean\comma{} simple and presentable GUI,This will help the user undertand what they can do\comma{} and make it easier to use.,Partial \checkmark,$UT_{1}$ to $UT_{8}$ (Table \ref{table:finalTestingUsability}) -- Final Testing for Usability was carried out to determine this success criterion. I gave it a partial success\comma{} as some of the individual tests were partial passes.
