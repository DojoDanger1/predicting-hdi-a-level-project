$T_{1}$,Overpass Turbo Query,{Closed Polygon\comma{}\newline{}Open Polygon\comma{}\newline{}Valid object type\comma{}\newline{}Invalid object type},The query should be able to handle both open and closed polygons as regions\comma{} and shouldn't break when an invalid object type is passed in.,Pass
$T_{2}$,Formula for distance between 2 points,{2 Points in the same hemisphere\comma{}\newline{}2 Points in opposite hemispheres\comma{}\newline{}2 Points either side of the international date line\comma{}\newline{}2 Points whose shortest distance crosses the North Pole},The formula should be resiliant to all of the listed edge cases\comma{} and will be checked using an online calculator.,Pass
$T_{3}$,$A\left(x\comma{}y\right)$,{Less than 500 $x$-objects\comma{}\newline{}500 $x$-objects\comma{}\newline{}More than 500 $x$-objects\comma{}\newline{}0 $x$-objects},If more than 500 $x$-objects\comma{} random sampling should happen to find 500 random $x$-objects. If there are 0 $x$-objects\comma{} \pil{None} should be returned\comma{} as there is no distance to find.,Pass
$T_{4}$,$D\left(x\right)$,{Region drawn Clockwise\comma{}\newline{}Region drawn Anticlockwise\comma{}\newline{}Region drawn in mulitple loops of the Earth\comma{}\newline{}Region that self-intersects},This function should be able to handle any region that does not self-intersect\comma{} no matter how it is drawn and how many times it wraps around the Earth. The correct area will be found on the internet (as I will be testing subnational regions),Pass
$T_{5}$,Neural Network works,{Using a \textit{different} data set\comma{} e.g. handwritten digits\comma{} which certainly has enough training data},This is to ensure that the neural network works\comma{} and if it doesn't work for predicting HDI\comma{} it is as a result of a lack of training data.,Pass
$T_{6}$,Overall Flow,{User Draws Region and then Predicts\comma{}\newline{}User tries to predict before selecting Region\comma{}\newline{}User draws region and doesn't predict},The only valid sequence of steps the user should be able to take is drawing the region and then making a prediction.,Pass
$T_{7}$,Optimal Place for New Building,{Building for which there exists 1 Factor\comma{}\newline{}Building for which there exists more than 1 Factor\comma{}\newline{}Building for which there exists 0 factors},This function should take an average over all of the factors the building is involved in\comma{} while throwing an error if it has 0 factors.,Pass
$T_{8}$,Suggestions fed back into Neural Network,{All 8 sugestions for where to place new buildings},A new predicted HDI for each suggestion,Pass
$T_{9}$,Encryption Algorithm,{\pil{password123}\comma{}\newline{}\pil{Password123}\comma{}\newline{}\pil{password123}},The resulting hashed password should be very different for each of these 3 inputs\comma{} to ensure that both the salting and hashing is working as expected,d
$T_{10}$,Creating an Account -- Username,{Username which does not yet exist\comma{}\newline{}Username which already exists\comma{}\newline{}Username comprised of only numbers},There should be no duplicate usernames\comma{} so users should only be able to pick a username that does not exist yet. Usernames must be strings\comma{} but the gradio textbox should handle this.,d
$T_{11}$,Creating an Account -- Password,{Password which contains no numbers\comma{}\newline{}Password which contains no special characters\comma{}\newline{}Password which is less than 8 characters\comma{}\newline{}Re-Entered Password does not match\comma{}\newline{}Password with at least 1 number and 1 special character\comma{} with length of at least 8 characters\comma{} and double entry verified},Passwords should specify all of the requirements\comma{} to ensure security for the user\comma{} and that they have correctly chosen a password,d
$T_{12}$,Logging In,{Username which does not exist\comma{}\newline{}Incorrect Password\comma{}\newline{}Existing username and Correct Password},The user should only be granted access to the account if they have entered an existing username with the correct password,d
